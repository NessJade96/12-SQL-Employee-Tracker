# 12-SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

Create a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. An interface called content management systems (CMS).
Please note the comments in my projects is not how I would normally code, this is in here for easy of navigation and understanding :)

## User story:

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

## User setup:

N/A at this stage

## Planning Notes:

1. Create database schema as per the img(data-schema.png) in assets. Create a seeds file to include some data during testing.
   (You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.)
